Uniqueness of name","text":"<p>The software has a unique name to identify it </p> Why should we measure it? How do we measure it? Types it applies to The name is commonly used as the main identifier of a software. Each tool should have a unique name to avoid ambiguities. Different versions of the same software should share a name, but if substantial modifications in the algorithm are done, the identifier should change for the new piece of software. A name is valid. all"},{"location":"indicators/F1_identity_uniqueness/#f12-identifiability-of-version","title":"F1.2. Identifiability of version","text":"<p>There is a scheme to uniquely and properly identify the software version.</p> Why should we measure it? How do we measure it? Types it applies to A version scheme is necessary to refer to a specific release of a software and keep track of the incrementally different versions of the software. A version of the form X.X is considered valid. all"},{"location":"indicators/F2_existence_of_metadata/","title":"F2.

Standardized Metadata","text":"<p>Metadata is described using accepted ontologies </p> Why should we measure it? How do we measure it? Types it applies to The same piece of information about a software can be stated in many equivalent forms. Each tool being described with different terminology, with non specified meanings, makes metadata very hard to interpret. Automatic processing is also harder. When searching for a software with certain features, the lack of a consusuate terminology makes the process of searching slow and difficult.
