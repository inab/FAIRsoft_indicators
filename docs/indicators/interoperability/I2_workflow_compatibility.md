# I2. Software Integration 

Whether software can be easily integrated into workflows or used in connection with other software. 

Research software is usually used with other software as part of a workflow or any other composition.

## I2.1. Existence of API/library version

### What is being measured? 

- Whether the software has an API/library version to be included in users' workflows. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Providing software as modular libraries or well-defined APIs is crucial for seamless integration into larger systems or workflows, ensuring compatibility and functionality across various platforms and environments. 

### How do we measure it? 

- The type of the software registered either as library or API is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to 

- all

### Weight 

- 0.5

## I2.2. E-infrastructure compatibility 

### What is being measured?

- Whether the software can be deployed in e-infrastructures. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Compatibility with e-infrastructures is critical, as researchers and professionals extensively use these platforms to build data processing pipelines. If software cannot be deployed on these infrastructures, it risks being inaccessible to many potential users, limiting its utility and adoption in essential workflows. 

### How do we measure it? 

- Being one of the metadata sources, the availability of the software through the Galaxy Toolshed is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to 

- all

### Weight 

- 0.5
