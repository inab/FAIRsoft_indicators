## F1.1. Uniqueness of name

### What is being measured?

### How do we measure it?
- A name is valid.

### Types it applies to
- all

### Weight 
- 0.8

A clear and consistent versioning scheme is crucial for distinguishing between different software releases, enabling precise communication and effective update management while also aiding in tracking incremental changes, thus ensuring that users can easily reference, use, and provide feedback on specific versions. 

### How do we measure it? 

A version of the form X.X is considered valid.
