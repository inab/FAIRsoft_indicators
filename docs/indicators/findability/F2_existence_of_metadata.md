# F2. Existence of Metadata

Whether the software is described with rich metadata, including scientific applicability. 

Metadata makes it possible to find tools through search engines and decide if they interest the user.

## F2.1. Existence of structured metadata 


### What is being measured? 
- Whether metadata is adjusted to specific metadata formats. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Using specific, structured metadata formats enhances machine readability, which not only increases the software's findability by search engines but also improves interoperability and facilitates the accurate extraction and utilisation of data, thereby boosting its usability and accessibility for both humans and machines. 

### How do we measure it? 

- Any source of structured metadata (e.g. JSON, XML, YAML) is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to 

- all

### Weight 
- 0.6

## F2.2. Existence of standardised metadata 


### What is being measured? 
- Whether metadata is described using accepted ontologies. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Standardised metadata using consensual terminology simplifies the interpretation and automated processing of software descriptions by ensuring a uniform approach to information representation. This uniformity enhances search efficiency and accuracy, making finding software with specific features easier and faster. 

### How do we measure it? 

- Use of EDAM and/or Bioschemas to describe the software is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to

- all

### Weight 
- 0.4
