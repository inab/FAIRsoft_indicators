# F3.  Discoverability 

How software can be found. There are multitude of mechanisms for scientists looking to find specific software

(*) Scoring of high-level indicator F3 is based on the number of low-level indicators fulfilled: One fulfilled low-level indicator scores 0.7, two fulfilled indicators score 0.85, and fulfillment of all three indicators scores 1.0

## F3.1. Discoverability in software registries

### What is being measured?

- Whether software is included in the main software registries. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Software registries serve as primary resources for users seeking specific resources, and ensuring software is discoverable in these registries enhances visibility, facilitates peer recognition, and increases the potential for adoption and collaboration.

### How do we measure it? 
- At least one software registry among the metadata sources is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to 

- all 

### Weight

## F3.2. Discoverability in software repositories

### What is being measured? 

- Whether software can be found in any of the major software repositories. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Users can use software repositories as additional resources when looking for research software. Listing software in repositories such as GitHub and GitLab enhances its visibility and accessibility, making it easier for scientists to find, use, and contribute to software development. 

### How do we measure it? 

An associated software repository (GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket) is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to 

- all

### Weight

## F3.3. Discoverability in the scientific literature

### What is being measured? 

- Whether software can be found in specialised literature services. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Specialised scientific literature serves as a crucial reference for finding software, particularly new ones, as it not only enhances visibility and credibility but also provides detailed context and validation through citations and reviews, including the ones by peers. 

### How do we measure it? 

- At least one associated publication is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to 

- all

### Weight 
- (*)
