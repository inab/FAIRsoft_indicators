# Welcome to FAIRsoft Indicators!

The FAIRsoft indicators are designed to automatically measure the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of research software. By leveraging these indicators, developers and stakeholders can greatly enhance the impact and sustainability of their software projects.

Explore the indicators in depth and learn how to integrate them into your software initiatives in the [Indicators](./indicators/index.md) section.
