# A1.  Existence of an available working version

Whether it is possible to access/download/build a working version of the software.  

Being able to access the software as a user is the central aspect of Accessibility.

## A1.1. Existence of an API or web interface

### What is being measured? 

- Whether it is possible to access a working version of the software through an API or web interface.


### Why should we measure it? 

- Providing an API or web interface allows remote access with just an internet connection, greatly enhancing the software's usability, facilitating integration with other systems, and enabling a broader range of users to benefit from its features without complex installations. 

### How do we measure it? 

- A working URL is considered valid. 


### Types it applies to 

- web

## A1.2. Existence of downloadable and buildable software working version 

### What is being measured?  

- Whether it is possible to access/download/build a working version of the software including the generation of a software container. 

### Why should we measure it?

- A downloadable and buildable version of the research software significantly increases its freedom of use and usability. It allows users to install and run the software where and as needed, e.g. to use locally and in/as modules. 

### How do we measure it? 

- At least one download working link is considered valid.


### Types it applies to 

- non-web

--- 

## A1.3. Existence of installation instructions 

### What is being measured? 

- Whether there is a set of instructions and other necessary information that the user can follow to build the software. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Clear installation instructions are essential for ensuring successful software setup, reducing installation and deployment time, minimising potential errors, and enhancing overall user experience.  

### How do we measure it? 

-  A link explicitly stated as installation instructions or manual, instructions on the web if Bioconductor package, and availability through Galaxy ToolShed are all considered valid.


### Types it applies to

- non-web

## A1.4. Existence of test data 

### What is being measured? 

- Whether test data is available. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Test data confirms the software's functionality and provides users with practical examples for setting up their own datasets, thereby increasing usability and ensuring robustness. 

### How do we measure it?

- At least one piece of test data is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to

- all

## A1.5. Existence of software source code 

### What is being measured?  

- Whether software source code is available.

### Why should we measure it? 

- The availability of source code allows users to compile the software on various operating systems, address installation challenges, manage dependencies, and customise the code to meet specific needs, enhancing adaptability and user control. 

### How do we measure it? 

- A link explicitly stated as source code is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to 

- non-web
