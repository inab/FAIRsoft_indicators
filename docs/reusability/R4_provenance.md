# R4. Existence of Versioning and Historical Traceability 

How effectively the software manages version control and documents historical changes, ensuring clear updates traceability and consistency in release practices for enhanced reliability, sustainability and auditability. 

Explicit version control and documented historical changes facilitate efficient maintenance and debugging, enhance regulatory compliance, and build trust among users and developers by promoting transparency and accountability in the software's evolution.

## R4.1. Use of version control 

### What is being measured? 

- Whether the software follows a version-control system. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Using version control is crucial as it systematically records and tracks changes to the software, making it easier to manage updates and trace modifications over time. 

### How do we measure it? 

- A software repository hosted in GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab is considered valid. 

### Types it applies to 

- all

## R4.2. Existence of a release policy 

### What is being measured? 

- Whether the software follows a defined and documented release policy. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- A clear release policy is essential because it informs users about the changes and improvements between software versions, enabling them to understand updates and make informed decisions about upgrades. 

### How do we measure it? 

- Not measured. 

### Types it applies to 

- all

## R4.3. Existence of metadata of previous versions in software repositories 

### What is being measured? 

- Whether there is available metadata of previous versions. 

### Why should we measure it? 

- Maintaining metadata of previous versions in software repositories is crucial because it ensures users can verify the existence and specifics of past software versions, particularly those referenced in published research, thereby providing essential context and supporting reproducibility. 

### How do we measure it? 

- Not measured. 

### Types it applies to 

- all
