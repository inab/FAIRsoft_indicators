# I3. Dependencies availability

- ### I3.1. Dependencies statement

    Whether the software includes details about dependencies

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  A clear dependencies statement informs users about the additional software required to operate the main software effectively. This transparency helps in ensuring that all necessary components are installed, which facilitates a smoother setup and operational experience.  | At least one dependency stated is valid | all |


- ### I3.2. Dependencies are provided

    Whether the software includes its dependencies or mechanisms to access them

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  Providing dependencies along with the software can greatly enhance user convenience by minimizing the steps needed for installation. This method helps to eliminate common setup obstacles, facilitating a more streamlined and error-free user experience.  | If Bioconductor, Bioconda, or Galaxy among the sources is valid. | all |


- ### I3.3. Availability through dependencies-aware systems

    Whether the software is distributed via a dependencies-aware system

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  Ensuring software availability through dependencies-aware systems like package managers enhances accessibility and ease of installation. This feature allows users to manage software and its dependencies efficiently, improving reliability and reducing compatibility issues across different environments.  | If Bioconductor, Bioconda, or Galaxy among the sources is valid. | all |
