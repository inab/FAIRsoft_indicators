# I2. Workflow compatibility

- ### I2.1. Existence of API/library version

    Whether the software has API /library versions to be included in users' pipelines   

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  Providing software as modular libraries or well-defined APIs is crucial for seamless integration into larger systems or pipelines, ensuring compatibility and enhanced functionality across various platforms and environments.  | The type of the software being either library or API is considered valid | all |


- ### I2.2. E-infrastructure compatibility

    Whether the software can be deployed in e-infrastructures (e. g. Galaxy)

    | Why should we measure it?  | How do we measure it? | Types it applies to  |
    |----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
    |  Compatibility with e-infrastructures is critical, as these platforms are extensively used by researchers and professionals to build data processing pipelines. If software cannot be deployed on these infrastructures, it risks being inaccessible to a wide range of potential users, thereby limiting its utility and adoption in essential workflows.  | Being one of the metadata sources the Galaxy Toolshed is considered valid. | all |
