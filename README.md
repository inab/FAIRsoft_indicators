# FAIRsoft Research Quality Indicators

Welcome to the FAIRsoft Research Quality Indicators repository. This repository hosts the specification of various indicators that measure and evaluate the quality of research software. These indicators are designed to be automatically evaluated and have been utilized both in academic publications and within the broader software observatory ecosystem.

## About the Indicators

The indicators are detailed in the `docs/indicators` directory in Markdown format. Each indicator includes:

- **Name**: The title of the indicator.
- **What does it measure?**: The aspect of software quality being measured.
- **Why is it important?**: The relevance of the metric to overall software quality.
- **How is it measured?**: Methodology used to evaluate the metric.
- **Type of software it applies to**: Classifications of software the indicator is applicable to.
- **Weight**: The importance of the indicator in the overall evaluation.

These indicators are crucial for developers, researchers, and analysts interested in assessing the quality of software in a structured and quantifiable manner.
